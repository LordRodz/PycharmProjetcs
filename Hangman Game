This is my first game while improving my programming skills. It's a simple game and have no objetive of hurt anyone's feelings. If so, please contact so i can make changes on it.
As said before, it's a simple game and maybe i'll improve it by adding some images like parts of a neutral body (all draws that i'll make). Can be called version 1.0 or less.
Once opened, you'll be introduced to the Rule question, and if Yes (or Sim), you'll get a full explanation of how it works and then the game starts. Else, the game starts at once.
